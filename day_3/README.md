# Angular Concluded

## Movie Search Lab

- For this lab we will be building an application that can search for movies in a database and display the results.
- The frontend is already done for you [here](https://github.com/arun-projects/Movie-Search-App).
- Your job is to create an Angular application that searches the OMDB API for movies and returns results to the UI.
- To hide and show the search box you will have to look into [ngShow](https://docs.angularjs.org/api/ng/directive/ngShow).
